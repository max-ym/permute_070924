# This file defines the schema for an employment record sink.
# Permute framework will use this schema to validate the data sink, which should be
# registered from the implementation code. If this schema is not compatible with the registered
# data sink, the framework will raise an error.
# So this file is a contract between the implementation code and the configuration file.
#
# The reason it is done that way is to allow the implementation code to be decoupled from the
# configuration file. Also, any Permute validators would be able to validate YAML configuration
# without knowing the implementation specifics.
